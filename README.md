# PyTorch_Examples
Development of machine learning algorithms using Pytorch Deep learning Framework.

In these examples, we gradually make our way into the world of Deep learning and how to use Deep learning frameworks.

The main Focus here is Pytorch.

We first implement Neural Nets using numpy arrays, then move on to implmenting the same with tensors and then using the proceed to experience the magic of autograd and back propagation.
While doing this I ll be comparing the results on each implementation.
