# DEEP DOODLE:
- *Doodles are Fun to draw and hard to classify, especially if I draw ;)*
-------------------------------------------------------------------
TO DO: 
1. Add Accuracy plots of all models for comparison

In this project I intend to experiment with various machine learning algorithms on a classification problem.

**Task:** Classify images, ones that are shitty drawn i.e., doodles.

**DateSet:** [Google Quickdraw DataSet](https://github.com/vijayaramilla/Deep_Doodle-ConvNets/tree/master/data)


We experiment with many algorithm, list provided below. We take baby steps, first implementing simple algorithms, experiment with numpy, tensors, then the shit gets real. We play with PyTorch and its Autograd functionality. Implement Nueral Network, Then the Deep ones (real deep), Convolutional Neural Network and then finally more sophisticated CNN.

We play with several parameters while implementing the algorithms. Details are provided in the respective sections and also the Jupyter notebooks with visualization. Lets rock!!

Before jumping in to the actual implementations, lets play with the easy implementation.
